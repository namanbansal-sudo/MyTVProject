## TV specific file extensions

This project includes an [example Metro configuration](./metro.config.js) that allows Metro to resolve application source files with TV-specific code, indicated by specific file extensions (`*.ios.tv.tsx`, `*.android.tv.tsx`, `*.tv.tsx`).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
