## üöÄ Features

- **Spatial Navigation**: Seamless D-pad navigation across dashboard, maps, and control rails
- **Smart TV Optimized**: Built for Android TV and Apple TV platforms
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Navigate through US Map, Weather, News, and Settings
- **Weather Map Forecasting**: Live cloud clusters with focus states, details panel, and TV-friendly pan mode
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and platforms

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- [Expo](https://expo.dev) with [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction)
- [React Native TV](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/react-native-tvos)
- [React Native TV Config Plugin](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/config-tv)
- Custom spatial navigation implementation for React Native TV

## üöÄ How to use

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Expo CLI
- Android Studio (for Android TV development)

### Development

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server for TV
EXPO_TV=1 npm run start

# For mobile development (without TV features)
npm run start
```

### Building for TV Platforms

```sh
# Prebuild for TV
EXPO_TV=1 npm run prebuild:tv

# Build for Android TV
EXPO_TV=1 npm run android

# Build for Apple TV
EXPO_TV=1 npm run ios
```

## üì± Navigation

Use your TV remote's D-pad to navigate:

- **Left/Right**: Navigate between dashboard cards and drawer button
- **Up/Down**: Move between rows of cards
- **SELECT/ENTER**: Activate focused items
- **Back**: Close drawer and return to dashboard

## üéØ Dashboard Features

1. **US Map**: Interactive map with city clusters
2. **Weather**: Interactive cloud clusters, detailed forecasts, and TV pan mode
3. **News**: Latest news and updates
4. **Settings**: App preferences and configuration

### Weather Map Controls

The Weather tab embeds a Leaflet-powered map rendered inside a WebView with fully TV-compatible controls:

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Focus Map** | Moves D-pad focus back to the map clusters |
| **Pan Map Mode** | Toggles a DPAD-driven pan mode; when enabled use the arrow keys to move the map view. Press OK again to exit |
| **Zoom In / Zoom Out** | Adjust map zoom level (clamped between 2.0 and 9.0) |
| **Forecast Details** | Opens a rich details panel for the focused cloud cluster (press again to close) |
| **Fullscreen** | Expands the map to full screen; press again to exit |

While the map is focused:

- **Arrow Keys** cycle between cloud clusters (default mode) or pan the map (pan mode)
- **OK/Enter** selects a cluster, toggles its detail panel, or toggles pan mode depending on the focused control
- A badge overlays the focused cluster with its icon, region, and current condition

Each cloud cluster displays animated cloud markers sized by coverage, color-coded to the system, and highlights on focus/selection. Selecting a cluster zooms the map and opens a panel with temperature, humidity, wind, coverage, alerts, and short-term forecasts.

## üîß Development Notes

- Set `EXPO_TV=1` environment variable to enable TV-specific features
- The app uses custom spatial navigation implementation optimized for React Native TV
- Components include visual focus indicators for better UX on TV devices
- Deploy on iOS and Android using: `npx eas-cli build` ‚Äî [Learn more](https://expo.dev/eas)

## TV specific file extensions

This project includes an [example Metro configuration](./metro.config.js) that allows Metro to resolve application source files with TV-specific code, indicated by specific file extensions (`*.ios.tv.tsx`, `*.android.tv.tsx`, `*.tv.tsx`).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
